                p.strategy-slide__description Suppose we have two candles and we are at the opening of the third candle. The trading robot looks at the low price of the penultimate candle, then looks at the price hi of the last candle, and if the price hi is above the low price, then a sell deal is opened. If another situation and the penultimate candle with the low price is greater than the last candle with the price hi, then a deal on bay opens.

                p.strategy-slide__description What this indicator shows: it has two levels: 1-level 70 and 2-level 30 between these levels, a line is drawn which, when crossing the lower level, indicates that the price is greatly oversold and means that the price will soon rise. It follows that when the line crosses the lower level to the top, the bay transaction opens and when the price moves the upper level down, the sell transaction opens. A very popular strategy described in many technical analysis books.

                p.strategy-slide__description In this strategy, the trading robot also looks at the last two candles; if the last candle has risen relative to the penultimate, the bay transaction is opened, and if the candle has fallen relative to the penultimate, the sell deal is opened. A trading robot takes the value of indicators and the value of candles from the timeframe on which it is launched, we have this H1.
